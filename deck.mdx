- Server for DB, php
- Maintenance
- Cost
- Tough to make fast

```notes
- New nothing at the time
- Shared hosting sucked
- Tried running ec2 server, Maintenance and probably serious security holes
- But I love wordpress, they made tons of developers and starting point for many, they even do some crazy react stuff and the api is game changer
- Cheaper
- Easier
```

export default Split

![](images/angular.png)

- Cool no server, no DB (*s3)
- Blank screen js load

```notes
- Getting first internship learning angularjs (version 1)
- I can do anything in JS
- No server or DB

```

export default Split

<ClickCode image="images/gulp.png" imageTwo="images/gulp_code.png"/>

- Cool no server, no DB (*s3)
- SEO and sharing
- Static html
- Cheap and fast
- Way to complex always breaking
- Didn't need to reinvent the wheel

```notes
- Gulp is a build tool that pipes files through functions to transform
- Gulp made sense to me 
- First static site generator, outputting plain html, css and some js for fancy stuff
- I really didn't need some much custom code, this has been solved before
```

# Static sites?

- No servers (hey @pjapplez), serve only static content
- No backend database layer
- Speed (CDN)
- Low cost
- Static site generators (Jekyll, hexo, hugo, wintersmith, Gatsby)

![](images/jam.png)

```notes
- html css and js
- not like the old days - js frameworks you do a lot with frontend js

JavaScript, APIs, Markup

- Running on the client js
- Use services via APIs (thirdparty stuff)
- Markup done at build time using generator tools 

```
