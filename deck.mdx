export default Split

![](images/wordpress-logo2.jpg)

- Server for DB, php 👎
- Maintenance 👎
- Cost 👎
- Tough to make fast 👎

```notes
- New nothing at the time
- Shared hosting sucked
- Tried running ec2 server, Maintenance and probably serious security holes
- But I love wordpress, they made tons of developers and starting point for many, they even do some crazy react stuff and the api is game changer
- Cheaper
- Easier
```

export default Split

<ClickCode image="images/angular.png" imageTwo="images/angular_code.png"/>

- Cool no server (*s3, CDN), no DB 👌
- Wait for js to load 👎
- No real routing 👎
- no SEO, no sharing 👎

```notes
- Getting first internship learning angularjs (version 1)
- I can do anything in JS
- No server or DB
- Blank screen till js loads
- curl website, u get no seo or sharing things on facebook and etc (I know there are ways fo fix this)
```

export default Split

<ClickCode image="images/gulp.png" imageTwo="images/gulp_code.png"/>

- Cool no server (*s3, CDN), no DB 👌
- SEO and sharing 👌
- Static html 👌
- Cheap and fast 👌
- Way to complex always breaking 👎
- Didn't need to reinvent the wheel 👎

```notes
- Gulp is a build tool that pipes files through functions to transform
- Gulp made sense to me 
- First static site generator, outputting plain html, css and some js for fancy stuff
- I really didn't need some much custom code, this has been solved before
```

# Static sites?

- No servers kind of, serving only static content
- No backend database layer
- Speed (CDN)
- Low cost
- SEO friendly
- Static site generators (Jekyll, hexo, hugo, wintersmith, Gatsby)

![](images/jam.png)

```notes
- Simple servers (already figured out how to send static files quickly)
- html css and js
- not like the old days - js frameworks you do a lot with frontend js

JavaScript, APIs, Markup

- Running on the client js
- Use services via APIs (thirdparty stuff)
- Markup done at build time using generator tools 

```

- SEO and sharing 👌
- Cheap and Fast 👌
- Plugins to solve tasks 👌
- Markdown files 👌
- Focus on theme/presentation only 👌
- Slow navigation 👎
- Miss js in page, need to load later 👎

```notes

- No very modern
- Not seemless from js, theme to what gets made 
```
